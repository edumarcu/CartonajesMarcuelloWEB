<h1>Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles</h1>
<p>Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. And until then, I can never die?</p>
<h2>Bendless Love</h2>
<p>Look, last night was a mistake. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! No, she'll probably make me do it. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.</p>

<p>And then the battle's not so bad? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.

<h4>Where the Buggalo Roam</h4>
<p>Daylight and everything. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Bite my shiny metal ass. Daylight and everything. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?</p>
<ol>
<li>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</li>
<li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>
<li>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars.</li>
<li>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</li>
<li>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</li>
</ol>
<h5>The Honking</h5>
<p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!</p>
