            <h1>The Honking</h1>
            <p>Why would I want to know that? Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? Actually, that's still true. Really?! Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</p>
            <h2>Bendin' in the Wind</h2>
            <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Yep, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics, then retired to promote alcoholic beverages! I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Soothe us with sweet lies.</li>
            <li>And until then, I can never die?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>A Bicyclops Built For Two</h3>
            <p>Bite my shiny metal ass. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults. Bite my shiny metal ass. A sexy mistake.</p>
            <h4>Future Stock</h4>
            <p>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared&hellip; How much did you make me? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Daylight and everything.</p>
            <ol>
            <li>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!</li>
            <li>Why would I want to know that?</li>
            <li>Ow, my spirit!</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Mars University</h5>
            <p>Of all the friends I've had&hellip; you're the first. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Ow, my spirit! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</p>
            <h6>The Why of Fry</h6>
            <p>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. We're also Santa Claus! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.</p>
            <p>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Ask her how her day was. Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
            <p>Why did you bring us here? Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
            <p>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. I love you, buddy! What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. And until then, I can never die? Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.</p>
            <p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Pansy. Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
            <p>Look, last night was a mistake. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Is that a cooking show?</p>
