            <h1>That Darn Katz!</h1>
            <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Shut up and take my money! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>
            <h2>The Series Has Landed</h2>
            <p>Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Why did you bring us here? Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in.</li>
            <li>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</li>
            <li>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Where No Fan Has Gone Before</h3>
            <p>But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. What are their names? Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Why would I want to know that?</p>
            <h4>Leela's Homeworld</h4>
            <p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. Actually, that's still true. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</p>
